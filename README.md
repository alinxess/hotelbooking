# Hotel Booking

Built a hotel booking/reservation system using MERN STACK (react, express, mongoDB, nodejs) and RESTful API, 
JWT authentication, CRUD Operations, custom hooks, and React calendar.

User can see hotels and its different types of rooms and book it for a particular date and bill is generated 
according to rooms types and number of days.
